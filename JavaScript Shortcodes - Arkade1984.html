    Summary:
Methods: Invoked on objects.
Methods combine complex steps that operate on a specific object.

<div>
    
Syntax:
<div>
    
        
object.method(parameters)
    
Example:    
<div>

var w = fgImage.getWidth();
var h = fgImage.getHeight();
    
    
    Syntax of Method Call;

object <= we want to invoke method on
. <= the dot means (inside of)
method <= to call
() <= Specify parameters
; <= closing 

</div></div>
      
    
    
        What are Parameters?
    
var pixel = fgImage.getPixel(0,0)
    
Example:    
<div>
    
    
var fg = new SimpleImage("drewRobert.png")
    
var pixel = fgImage.getPixel(0,0)
    
Summary:
-Specific information on what it is supposed to do.
-getPixel: which pixel to get, as(x,y)
      
</div>
    
    
        Calling Methods: Semantics 
<div>

    Summary:
-Execution goes into the method.
-Do whatever code is there.
-The method returns an answer back.
-Method call evaluates to that value.
-Execution resumes after the method       call.
    
..Methods all you need is the code to have it do something, following the symantics of the code.
-Documentaton tells you what it does.
    
    
    
</div>
 
        Functions
   
    Summary:
Functions: not invoked on objects.
Similar syntax to method but no "object"
    
-Can create your own, to not have to duplicate code. 
-To make testing and debugging easier
    
<div>
    
    
    Example:

print(x);
    
    
    Creating your own Function
    
    function square(x) {
    var ams = x* x;
    return ans-wer;
    }
    
    var y = square(4)

    
    Functions symantics:
    <div>
        
        Syntax:
    
function square(x) {
    var ans-wer = x * x;
    return ans-wer
    
    }   

        
        Semantics (from above):
    
function <= Define New function. 
square <= Name of function (anyname).
(x) <= Parameter "Act Like" Variables.
-or what perticular number to square.
-multiple names, seperate with camas, example(0,0)               
{} <= Bod of the function:
    -Specifies what the function should do.       
return ans-wer; <=
Return,statement,Return(expression);
-how a functions says what its answer is.  Keyword Return, 
-Value of an expression whos value 
-Should give back as its answer, followed by a semicolon.

</div>
        
        
    First Call the function
//Note (Slide): Writing your own Function.
 

Syntax:        
<div>
        

    
var y = square(4);

        
        Semantics (from above):
        
square(4) 
-Function Call; How we make use of it.
 
        Behavior: decloration itself is not executed, it just tells the computer what the function means for later use.
        
</div>
      
        
Example:
<div>
    
        Syntax:

var y = square(4);
        
Squaring (4) <= Results of that computation gives us the results of that computation to Call to function;
                      
-Examples of "Abstraction", and give that computation a simple interfcace.
                      
        Example:
                      
Call image.getwidth(), 
    <= it gets width of the image.
    
</div></div> 
    
    
    
    
        Types of Date
    
    Summary:
Functions: 

-Everything is a Numner
-..but what does a number mean?
Specifies how to:
-Interpret that number
-And How to operate on it.

        Javascript Ram.Memory
    
    Summary: JavaScript allocates memory when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and “automatically” frees it up when they are not used anymore, a process called garbage collection.

Functions: 

- Temperarly Stores on Ram
- Code is lost when Ram desktop is restarted.
